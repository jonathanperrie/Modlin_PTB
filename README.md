# Modlin PTB GeoMx
This is a supporting document to outline how to perform all of the analysis in our paper starting from the DCC files, metadata, and fluorescent markers channels. 

Some parts not included: fitting bounding boxes and adjusting image channel intensities. 

All plots and data should be on Box under GeoMx folder.

# Figures 
1. Primary granuloma types
  - Diagram (made in ppt)
  - PCA / UMAP
  - Major DGE
  - Pathways and enrichment
2. Deconvolution
  -  Heatmap
  -  Cell markers
  -  SaVant signatures
  -  Sample subtype composites
3. Subtypes 
  - Sample PTB 22.1 (missing two spots out of shot)
  - Co-occurence matrix (expected/observed)
  - Subtype marker differences 
  - Minor DGE
  - Pathways and enrichment

# Roadmap
1. Get raw and normalized counts and metadata 
2. HLCA cell type sampling 
3. Cell2location enviroment set-up
4. DGE gene hits for cell type signatures (undecided if we'll do this exactly)
5. Spot marker alignment
