# Modlin PTB GeoMx
This is a supporting document to outline how to perform all of the analysis in our paper starting from the DCC files, metadata, and fluorescent markers channels. 

# Roadmap
1. Get raw and normalized counts and metadata 
2. HLCA cell type sampling 
3. Cell2location enviroment set-up
4. DGE gene hits for cell type signatures (undecided if we'll do this exactly)
5. Spot marker alignment
